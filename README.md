# RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection

## Description
Intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs inside the cranium, is a serious health problem requiring rapid and often intensive medical treatment. For example, intracranial hemorrhages account for approximately 10% of strokes in the U.S., where stroke is the fifth-leading cause of death. Identifying the location and type of any hemorrhage present is a critical step in treating the patient.

Diagnosis requires an urgent procedure. When a patient shows acute neurological symptoms such as severe headache or loss of consciousness, highly trained specialists review medical images of the patient’s cranium to look for the presence, location and type of hemorrhage. The process is complicated and often time consuming.

In this competition, your challenge is to build an algorithm to detect acute intracranial hemorrhage and its subtypes.

You’ll develop your solution using a rich image dataset provided by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA®) in collaboration with members of the American Society of Neuroradiology and MD.ai.

## Hemorrhage Types
While all acute (i.e. new) hemorrhages appear dense (i.e. white) on computed tomography (CT), the primary imaging features that help Radiologists determine the subtype of hemorrhage are the location, shape and proximity to other structures (see table).

Intraparenchymal hemorrhage is blood that is located completely within the brain itself; 

intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage is blood that has leaked into the spaces of the brain that normally contain cerebrospinal fluid (the ventricles or subarachnoid cisterns). 

Extra-axial hemorrhages are blood that collects in the tissue coverings that surround the brain (e.g. subdural or epidural subtypes). ee figure.) 

Patients may exhibit more than one type of cerebral hemorrhage, which c may appear on the same image. While small hemorrhages are less morbid than large hemorrhages typically, even a small hemorrhage can lead to death because it is an indicator of another type of serious abnormality (e.g. cerebral aneurysm).
